# EcoMotion Project 🌱⚡

EcoMotion is a school graduation project designed to merge **sustainable energy innovation** with **advanced digital technologies**, including **AI-driven features and chatbot systems**, to enhance user experience and community engagement.

## 🌍 Project Overview

EcoMotion focuses on **capturing kinetic energy from vehicle movements** and converting it into clean, usable electricity. This effort is complemented by a **smart website and mobile app** that connect users, municipalities, and environmental organizations with real-time data, awareness materials, and community interaction tools.

Our project reflects the **UAE's 2023 Year of Sustainability goals**, addressing the growing demand for green solutions while introducing **AI-enhanced services** to create a smarter, safer, and more interactive user experience.

## 🤖 AI and Chatbot Integration

To elevate the user experience and support eco-conscious behavior:
- We integrated an **AI-powered chatbot** on the website to provide instant support, answer FAQs, and assist users in navigating the platform.
- The chatbot leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to personalize interactions and collect valuable user feedback for **continuous improvement using data analytics and AI models**.
- Future planned upgrades include **AI-driven energy usage prediction dashboards** and **automated sustainability reports** for users and municipalities.

## 💡 Project Highlights
- **IoT + AI** integration for environmental data collection.
- **AI chatbot** to guide, educate, and support users.
- **Mobile-first responsive web application** with secure user data management.
- **Real-world market validation** via surveys and expert consultations.

## 🚀 Future Vision

Our roadmap includes:
